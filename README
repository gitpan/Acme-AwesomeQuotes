NAME
    Acme::AwesomeQuotes - Make your text awesome!

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::AwesomeQuotes;
      my $awesome_text = GetAwesome('Wyld Stallyns');
      say q(I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire!);
      say q(And I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan!);
      say ('And we are ', $awesome_text, '!');

DESCRIPTION
    Tired of ordinary quotation marks that lack punch?

    Looking for something that can better convey just how *awesome* your
    words are?

    You need `àwesome quoteś´!

FUNCTIONS
  GetAwesome
    "GetAwesome()" is the module’s only function, and is exported by
    default. It takes a single scalar string argument, and returns that
    string with the following changes applied:

    *   a grave accent (or backtick, U+0060) is prepended;

    *   a combining grave accent is added to the first letter;

    *   a combining acute accent is added to the final letter;

    *   an acute accent (U+00B4) is appended;

    In addition, leading/trailing whitespace and punctuation is stripped,
    and the returned string is in NFC.

    Combining characters already present in the string are respected, and
    existing initial/terminal grave/acute accents will not be doubled.
    However, in cases where both a grave and acute accent may be applied –
    such as if the initial letter has an acute accent, or if the string
    consists of only a single letter – a caron is used instead, because
    combining grave and acute accents on the same character doesn’t look so
    hot. :)

LIMITATIONS
    *   N.B. that the first and last characters of the supplied string must
        be *letters*; leading/trailing whitespace and punctuation will be
        stripped, and if the resulting first/last character is not a letter
        an exception will be raised. Letters may be from any script covered
        by Unicode. Because leading/trailing punctuation is stripped, if
        your text is to go e.g. at the end of a sentence, you should apply
        the full-stop *after* calling "GetAwesome()".

    *   The returned string is in NFC; combining accents will therefore
        occur as separate characters only if there is no code point for the
        corresponding character+accent.

    *   A string that is already in `àwesome quoteś´ cannot be made *more*
        awesome by calling the function on it repeatedly. :)

BUGS
    None known, doubtless many undiscovered.
